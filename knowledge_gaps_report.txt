The student has a solid understanding of basic concepts in graph neural networks, including node embeddings, dynamics of GNNs, and basic operational techniques like stochastic gradient descent. However, they struggle with more advanced theoretical concepts such as permutation equivariance and the criticism of shallow embedding methods. These gaps are crucial as they underpin many decisions in designing GNN architectures. Addressing these could enhance their capability to select appropriate methods and models for specific problems and applications in more sophisticated scenarios.
