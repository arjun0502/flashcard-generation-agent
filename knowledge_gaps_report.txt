The student shows competence in understanding fundamental properties of GNNs such as permutation invariance and equivariance. Tasks suitable for GNN application are also well understood. However, there is a consistent struggle with understanding complex topics like the advantage of deep over shallow encoders and the intricacies of network topology. Addition of supplementary flashcards addressing these areas could reinforce their understanding. Additionally, coverage of advanced concepts like methods of parameter efficiency in encoders and deeper insights into GNN loss functions will be beneficial.
